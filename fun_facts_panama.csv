5;Hike across the Darién gap;Trekking;You’ll probably say no to this one. It’s a hike of 15 days crossing the continental divide carrying your bed and your meals on your back.

7;Dance with the congos;Dancing;If you approach a congo dance, you run the risk of being asked to join in. Half afraid and half embarrassed, you will want to say no.

12; Find a sloth in the canopy;Animals;For an animal that’s so famously slow, sloths are really hard to find.

19;Eat a bowl of Panamanian sancocho;Cooking;Sancochos are cooked all over the Americas, but our favorite one is the Panamanian sancocho, which perfectly combines chicken, white yam and culantro in a soup that can work miracles: it curbs hunger, beats colds, and revives you after a night of wild partying.;[8.521065861962752, -80.0789838677837]

21;Pick coffee;Crops;Good coffee comes from good soil, and to get to your cup it needs good hands: your own. Look through the leaves and pick the ripest berries.
