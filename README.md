# the_panama_experience
This is my Code in Place final Project in which I aimed to foster the Panama culture in general, the idea was born since my days learning in CiP when I saw the only thing other learners with me knew about Panama it was about the Canal so I proposed to myself to show you more about my country and what can be done here in this magical place.🫶🏻
