# the_panama_experience
This is my Code in Place final Project in which I aimed to foster the Panama culture in general, the idea was born since my days learning in CiP when I saw the only thing other learners with me knew about Panama it was about the Canal so I proposed to myself to show you more about my country and what can be done here in this magical place.ü´∂üèª
So here is the product, a map which emphasizes Panama with leaves as touristic places or with activities you can enjoy here.

The information that is show here is from Biomuseo (a museum about the diversity of here in Panama, overall of the species of animals, environments and more! so I invite you to go there and learn more about) which I included as part of the touristic stuff you can do here in Panama. So enjoy this piece of effort of mine and find out a bunch of things you can plan for your next summer.

(p.s.: if u dont want to run the python script in your computer, just open the Panama.html file)
