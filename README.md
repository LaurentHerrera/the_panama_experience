# the_panama_experience
This is my Code in Place final Project in which I aimed to foster the Panama culture in general, the idea was born since my days learning in CiP when I saw the only thing other learners with me knew about Panama it was about the Canal so I proposed to myself to show you more about my country and what can be done here in this magical place.ü´∂üèª

The information that is show here is from Biomuseo (a museum about the diversity of here in Panama, overall of the species of animals, environments and more!) which I included as part of the touristic stuff you can do here in Panama. So enjoy this piece of effort of mine and find out a bunch of things you can plan for your next summer.

Feel free to add some features or reach me out to add aditional stuff to make it more interesting :)
